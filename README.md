# HTMLServ

A silly attempt to connect to InspIRCd's 1205 server-to-server protocol
from a web browser via WebSocket.  I know absolutely nothing about
JavaScript and web browsers, so this is *obviously* a good
first project in that environment.

Forked from [9pfs/hello-smile6's attempt for solanum](https://github.com/hello-smile6/html5-solanum-s2s-implementation/).

For a slightly more usable pseudo-server, consider HaxServ ([git.andrewyu.org](https://git.andrewyu.org/hax/coupserv.git)/[sr.ht](https://git.sr.ht/~runxiyu/haxserv)/[GitHub](https://github.com/runxiyu/haxserv)).
